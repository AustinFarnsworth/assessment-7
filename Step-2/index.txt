It looks like the unshift method was faster for the first two then when you get 
to the mediumArray push seems to be faster. so at that point push is faster for 
the rest of the way. This would be that push would make it a lot better to scale with. 
You are wanting to scale as fast and big as you can and push does it when you get 
more data in your arrays.

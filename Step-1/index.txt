Alternative Tools Research

TravisCI

Came across this CI and the documentaion was very straight forward. 
Sign up and connecting to repos was real easy. I didn't use this feature
but it looks like you can hook multiple repos at a time and it will build 
when you push it to github. Tells you what to put in your yml file very 
clearly which is key for a new devops. 

I started with this page https://docs.travis-ci.com/ . And it give you an 
option for a tutorial so i did that. Has a bunch of other great tools for 
connnecting with other tools like Gitlab or switching different programming 
languages. And even further reading more about builds, security, and databases. 

Im not entirely sure how long the company has been around but it looks like 
their first push to github was 4 years ago. That was like their code od conduct
and ethics and such. But they have had changes 15 months ago so that makes me 
belive that they are fairly active. They also have core values of openess and 
collaboration which i like. 

Pros 
- Good Core values
- Easy setup
- Documentation very thorough



Sentry

Sentry looks like a great tool for error monitoring. It has been around for awhile 
and is a fairly big company. Some of the features they have that i like are: the custom 
queries, very readable dashboard, and how easy it is to see between multiple projects. 
the graphs are very helpul. 

I started with this documentation for javascript https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/ . 
It is pretty straight forward and easy to switch to a different language. You do have to sign up 
for a certain teir. I think there are 4. The first free developer one seems alright but the other 
ones would be a little more pricey if you wanted to use it as a team. 

Pros 
- Big company with good track record
- Very clean and readable dashboard
- Good documentaion

Cons 
- Price
